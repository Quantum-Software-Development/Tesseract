## ðŸ§Š [Tesseract](): A Gateway to Higher Dimensions and Quantum Physics -  [Time Travel Through Dimensions]()

Welcome to the **Tesseract** repository! This project is dedicated to the study and exploration of the **Tesseract**, a four-dimensional analogy of a cube. Here, you will find resources, simulations, and mathematical insights that help visualize and better understand the properties of **higher-dimensional geometric figures** and their fascinating connection to **Quantum Physics**.

## ðŸŒŒ Project Overview

The **Tesseract**, also known as a **hypercube**, extends conventional geometry into the **fourth dimension**. This concept is not just a mathematical curiosityâ€”it has profound implications in physics, particularly in areas like **quantum mechanics, superstring theory, and spacetime models**.

This repository provides:

- **Tesseract Simulations**: Visual representations of a Tesseract projected into three dimensions.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Methods for computing and understanding the properties of four-dimensional objects.
- **Quantum Physics Insights**: How higher dimensions relate to quantum phenomena like entanglement, parallel universes, and extra-dimensional theories.

## ðŸ”¬ The Connection Between Tesseracts and Quantum Physics

The concept of higher dimensions plays a critical role in **quantum mechanics and theoretical physics**. Some key connections include:

- **Quantum Superposition & Higher Dimensions**: Quantum systems exist in multiple states simultaneously, much like how a Tesseract exists in four dimensions but appears differently when projected into lower dimensions.
- **Entanglement & Nonlocality**: Extra-dimensional spaces may offer explanations for quantum entanglement, where particles interact instantaneously across vast distances.
- **String Theory & Extra Dimensions**: Theoretical physics suggests that additional dimensions (like the 4th spatial dimension) could be fundamental to the fabric of reality.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To start exploring the Tesseract and its relation to quantum physics:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Quantum-Software-Development/Tesseract.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the assets directory** to find simulation resources.
3. **Follow the installation instructions** provided in the `INSTALL.md` file.
4. **Run the Tesseract Visualization Code** step by step to generate a 3D projection of a hypercube:

### Step 1: Import the required libraries
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
import numpy as np
```

### Step 2: Define the function to draw a Tesseract
```python
# Function to draw a Tesseract
def draw_tesseract(ax):
    # Points of a cube in 3D
    points = np.array([[1, 1, 1],
                       [-1, 1, 1],
                       [-1, -1, 1],
                       [1, -1, 1],
                       [1, 1, -1],
                       [-1, 1, -1],
                       [-1, -1, -1],
                       [1, -1, -1]])

    # Lines that connect the points to form a cube
    lines = [[points[i], points[j]] for i in range(len(points)) for j in range(i+1, len(points)) if np.sum(np.abs(points[i] - points[j])) == 2]

    # Draw each line of the cube
    for line in lines:
        ax.plot3D(*zip(*line), color="b")
```

### Step 3: Create a 3D figure and axis
```python
# Create a figure and a 3D axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
```

### Step 4: Draw the Tesseract and set axis limits
```python
# Draw the Tesseract
draw_tesseract(ax)

# Set the axis limits
ax.set_xlim([-2, 2])
ax.set_ylim([-2, 2])
ax.set_zlim([-2, 2])
```

### Step 5: Display the plot
```python
# Show the plot
plt.show()
```
